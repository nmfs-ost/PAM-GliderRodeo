There is a natural crossover between soundscape and bioacoustics measures; soundscape metrics will be all PAM metrics not directly associated with animal sounds.\nResource metrics: measures of resources (personnel, expertise, equipment, materials, time, budget) needed to implement the technology.\n\nWe are actively working with experts to develop a suite of metrics that provide a means of assessing each platform that can be completed with the available resources.

In addition, there may be (unfunded) opportunities for including alternative platforms within the Glider Rodeo effort (Please see section on ‘Inquiries’).\n\n\nNOAA’s Southwest Fisheries Science Center began deploying Slocum gliders to study Antarctic krill in 2018, and in 2025 they will expand their glider program with PAM-equipped gliders to study marine mammals off the U.S. West coast. Slocum Gliders are modular, and three different PAM systems will be tested: the DMON (developed by WHOI), WISPR (Embedded Ocean Systems), and JASCO OceanObserver.\n\n\n\nSeagliders are buoyancy driven autonomous underwater vehicles developed at the University of Washington.
