    "text": "The primary contemporary gliders with PAM capacity include Slocum, Seagliders, Ocean Scout, and SeaExporer. We understand that technology is rapidly changing, and even if we are unable to directly include additional platforms, we hope to learn more about technologies currently in development. In addition, there may be (unfunded) opportunities for including alternative platforms within the Glider Rodeo effort (Please see section on ‘Inquiries’).\n\n\nNOAA’s Southwest Fisheries Science Center began deploying Slocum gliders to study Antarctic krill in 2018, and in 2025 they will expand their glider program with PAM-equipped gliders to study marine mammals off the U.S. West coast. Slocum Gliders are modular, and three different PAM systems will be tested: the DMON (developed by WHOI), WISPR (Embedded Ocean Systems), and JASCO OceanObserver.\n\n\n\nSeagliders are buoyancy driven autonomous underwater vehicles developed at the University of Washington. Through a partnership with Dave Mellinger at Oregon State University, NOAA researchers at Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center has been testing the passive acoustic capabilities of these gliders to conduct marine mammal monitoring off Hawaii. They will continue this collaboration in 2025 as PIFSC builds out their own glider lab with SeaGliders with onboard WISPR acoustic processors. Seaglider support resources can be found here, and WISPR 2.0 specifications can be found here. Note that WISPR 3.0 is under development.\n\n\n\nThe Ocean Scout is a small glider developed as a ‘user friendly’ PAM-equipped glider. They are much smaller and require less training and expertise to use. Southwest Fisheries Science Center has procured two Ocean Scouts for testing and for specific scientific research efforts. The Ocean Scout specifications can be found here.\n\n\n\nThe SeaExplorer was developed by the French company Alcen-Alseamar. Alseamar SeaExplorers are not yet available for purchase in the United States, but the company offers their gliders as a service, with mission planning, piloting, and data delivery. We will include SeaExplorers in our Glider Rodeo (as a service). SeaExplorer specifications can be found here.\n\n\n\nWe understand that these technologies are rapidly developing, and we’d love to hear about new developments.

Glider performance and acoustic recording and detection metrics will be measured for each system to enable comparison and inform future glider acquisitions and use by NOAA Fisheries.\nThis is a unique opportunity to examine the performance and capability of a diverse set of currently available PAM-equipped underwater gliders, and we welcome community input into test design and assessment metrics. Results will be made publicly available to inform future research and development.\nThere may be unfunded opportunities for participation to compare other systems, and we may be able to provide logistical support.",

There is a natural crossover between soundscape and bioacoustics measures; soundscape metrics will be all PAM metrics not directly associated with animal sounds.\nResource metrics: measures of resources (personnel, expertise, equipment, materials, time, budget) needed to implement the technology.\n\nWe are actively working with experts to develop a suite of metrics that provide a means of assessing each platform that can be completed with the available resources.
